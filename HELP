neodba %s

Neodba is a simple, depedency-free CLI tool for interacting with databases.

USAGE: neodba [<OPTIONS>] [<SUB-COMMAND>] [<SUB-COMMAND ARGS>]

CONFIG:

Create a file named db-spec.edn to specify how to connect to your database.
This file must be in the current working directory when running neodba.
The following is a Postgresql example. For complete documentation see:
https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc/CURRENT/api/next.jdbc#get-datasource

  {:dbtype "postgres"
   :dbname "postgres"
   :user "postgres"
   :password "postgres"}

OPTIONS:

--log-level [FATAL|ERROR|WARN|SUCCESS|INFO|DEBUG|TRACE]
  Specify the log level
  The default value is INFO

--help, -h
  Show this help

--version
  Show current version

SUB-COMMANDS:

e, eval
  Evaluates the following arguments as a SQL statement. In the example below the
  single quotes are used to avoid having to escape the asterisk as it's a
  special shell character:

  neodba e 'select * from some_table'

  There are a few helpers to retrieve database metadata such as the following:

  neodba e '(get-catalogs)'
  neodba e '(get-schemas)'
  neodba e '(get-tables)'
  neodba e '(get-views)'

r, repl
  Starts a REPL where you can enter SQL statements. It is recommended to run
  Neodba with rlwrap to get proper readline support (history, arrow keys, etc.):

  rlwrap neodba r
