neodba %s

Neodba is a simple, depedency-free CLI tool for interacting with databases.

USAGE: neodba [<OPTIONS>] [<SQL><NIL>]

CONFIG:

A file named db-spec.edn is looked for in the current working directory
specifying the database connection. See this page:
https://cljdoc.org/d/com.github.seancorfield/next.jdbc/CURRENT/api/next.jdbc#get-datasource
for further details. Here is an example for Postgresql:

  {:dbtype "postgres"
   :dbname "postgres"
   :user "postgres"
   :password "postgres"}

OPTIONS:

--log-level [FATAL|ERROR|WARN|SUCCESS|INFO|DEBUG|TRACE]
  Specify the log level
  The default value is INFO

--help, -h
  Show this help

--version
  Show current version

<SQL>

When run with arguments (which are not CLI option flags) the arguments are
intrepreted as a SQL statement to execute. In the example below the single
quotes are used to avoid having to escape the asterisk as it's a special shell
character:

  neodba 'select * from some_table'

There are a few helpers to retrieve database metadata such as the following:

  neodba '(get-catalogs)'
  neodba '(get-schemas)'
  neodba '(get-tables)'
  neodba '(get-views)'

<NIL>

When no arguments are provided a REPL is started where you can enter SQL
statements. It is recommended to run Neodba with rlwrap to get proper readline
support (history, arrow keys, etc.), e.g.:

  rlwrap neodba
